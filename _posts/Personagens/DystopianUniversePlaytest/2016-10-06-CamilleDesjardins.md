## Stunts [ Refresh: 2 ]

+ `0`{: .fate_font} Because I have __great wealth__, the cost of equipment that I buy is 1  lower than usual, to a minimum of 1.
+ `1`{: .fate_font} Because __money talks__, whenever I buy equipment, I can choose to reduce the cost by 1. If I do, the GM gets 2 blowback.
+ `0`{: .fate_font} Because I __deal in favors__, when I gain the advantage in a social situation, I get an additional boost.
+ `1`{: .fate_font} Because __the camera loves me__, I can make a Manipulate- or Maneuver-based prep advantage without spending a prep action, but only if I tell the press something juicy (which gives the GM 5 blowback).
+ `1`{: .fate_font} Because I have __bodyguards__, I can choose to bring them into any conflict. If I do, they’re an aspect with a boost on it.
+ `0`{: .fate_font} Because __words cut__, when I deal harm in a social situation I can give the GM 1 blowback to force my opponent to mark an additional condition.
