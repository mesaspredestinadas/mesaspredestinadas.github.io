## Stunts [ Refresh: 2 ] 

+ __`0`{: .fate_font}__ Because I’m __just another citizen__, once per session, I can choose to ignore the effects of the Compromised or Blacklisted conditions during the current scene. If I do so, the opposition I have to roll against to clear these conditions increases by 2.
+ __`1`{: .fate_font}__ Because I can __spoof my markers__, once per mission I can recover from Compromised immediately by giving the GM 2 blowback. 
+ __`1`{: .fate_font}__ Because I __have eyes everywhere__, I get +2 to gain the advantage with Observe, provided I can access security cameras & the like.
+ __`0`{: .fate_font}__ Because I can __spike the A/R__, I can spend a fate point to take out all blanks and agents in a single zone without rolling, provided they have active neural casings. The GM gets blowback for each of them, though.
+ __`0`{: .fate_font}__ Because I can __spoof the A/R__, I can enter any scene disguised as someone else. My disguise is an aspect with a boost on it.
+ __`1`{: .fate_font}__ Because I post __screeds on the boards__, whenever I gain an advantage related to mobilizing the hacker underground of Paris Nouveau, I get an additional boost. I can give the GM blowback to get more boosts after I roll, at a rate of 2 blowback per boost.
